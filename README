Consider this to be in the public domain. You are free to do whatever you want
with this. I do not consider it big enough to license under GPL or similar.

Included files
--------------

	a form for posting to the pastebin
* catch.php
	recives and stores the paste
* error-handler.php
	for auto-completion like behaviour and php-code highlighting

	this file

Installation
------------

1. Create a new subdomain or directory on your webserver (not included).
2. Place the catch.php files and index.html in there. You can rename index.html if you want.
3. chmod webbserver+w on the directory.
4. If you want filename completion and syntax highlighting, configure your webserver to let error-handler.php handle 404's.
5. Add the crontab-row to your crontab and edit the path if you want automagic cleanup.
6. If you want to use the pastebin bash script, edit it and change $RECIVER_URL to match your setup.
